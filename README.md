# Titan Algorithms
A repository for various useful robotics software algorithms created and curated by FRC Team Titans 2022.

## Repository Structure
This repository contains three subprojects: `lib`, `demos`, and `dev`. The purpose of these are described below.

### `lib` subproject
This is the primary subproject of this repository, containing the Titan Algorithms library.

### `demos` subproject
This subproject contains source code for demos of various uses of the Titan Algoirthms library.

The `build.gradle` file of this repository contains instructions for building the `demos` subproject into an executable jar file that runs one of the provided demos.

### `dev` subproject
The `dev` subproject provides a working environment for interactive development of the Titan Algorithms library. because the primary use of this subproject is interactive development of projects related to the Titan Algorithms library, most changes to this subproject should not be committed.
